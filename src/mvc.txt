MVC -> Model View Controller

Components of any architecture:

Business logic -> Code that solves the actual business problem. Directly related to what business does and what it needs. 
Exemple: Sending messages, storing trasactions, calculating taxes.

State -> Essentially stores all the data about the application. Should be the single source of truth. UI should be kept in sync with the state. State libraries exist.

HTTP Libraries -> Responsible for making and recive AJAX calls. Optional but almost always necessary in real-world apps.

Application logic -> Code that only concernd about the implementation itself. Handle navigation and UI events.
